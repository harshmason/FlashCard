HELLO! 

Recently created a Flashcard tool to use for school. Building this helped me with file I/O and I highly recommend it for new students of OOP. 

It can read your file containing your Terms/Definitions. Save new data in the same text file without altering your old terms/def. Can use to study current flashcards and delete
terms you no longer need.
